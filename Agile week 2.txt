Scrum

    - a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
    - means that a team can use Scrum to create valuable products for their users, even when the environment or industry they're in is hard to predict and there are many risks

Iterative
     - repeating cycles of delivery

Incrementa
    - work is divided into smaller chunks that build on each other
    - The product is built over time through work done during each iteration

Empiricism
    - a scientific theory that depicts that the idea that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience.

3 foundational pillars of Empiricism (AKA the three pillars of Scrum)
    - transparency
    - inspection
    - adaptation

transparency
    - we make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome.
    - everyone must be transparent.
    - transparency inside the scrum team is critcal to the team's productivity and the project's completion
    - transparency means also building trust outside of the scrum team, like the stakeholders(customers, sponsors, and management )
    - encourages more collaboration and fewer mistakes

inspection
    - refers to conducting timely checks towards te outcome of a sprint goel to detect undesirable variances.
    - when teams work in an agile way, a stakeholder review of their work is a necessary opportunity for growth and progress.
    - the more inspection that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in their work.
    - There's real valuye to be gained from delibrerate inspection while you have a chance to change and improve.

Adaptation
    - Continuously searching for ways to adjust our project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.

In a nutshell
    Transparency and inspection gives Scrum teams the information and opportunity they need to identify improvements or changes. 
    althouogh adaptations include immediate fixes to problems, it may also be about implementing a change so future projects don't repeat past mistakes

Scrum master vs project manager

scrum master is responisble for helping the team understand scrum theory and practice. they ensure sucrm events take place and hel the team focus on delivering value
by removing impediments. but unlike a traditional project manager, they do not take on the management of changes in scope or priorities.
additionallym scrum master do not maintain tradional project artifacets like gantt charts.

==================================================================================
PRoduct owner vs project manager

In traditional project management, scope management is the primary responsibility of the project manager. But in Scrum, the definition and management of product scope falls to the
 Product Owner. Conversely, the Product Owner isn’t responsible for team performance—they aren’t considered to be a manager. The project manager leads the project team to meet the
  project’s objectives and oversees tasks and progress.

There are also similarities between the Product Owner and project manager roles. For instance, both roles are tasked with stakeholder management. This means they both must practice 
and facilitate effective communication among team members and stakeholders.

Additionally, in many companies—including Google—the definition of product or solution scope is the responsibility of a separate role called a product manager. So, it is 
important when joining any new company to discover how that company approaches the area of product definition, requirements development, and user research to understand what they 
consider to be the domain of the project manager.

A great product owner...

Embraces, shares and socialize the product vision.

    , provides clariityt for the developement team, and increase the chances of product success drastically.

Exceeds the customer's expectations
    - truly understands the custmers intentions and goals with the product and is able to outstrup its expectations. customer delight is the ultimate goal.

is empowered.
    - empowered to make decistions related to the product. sure createing support for their decisions might take some time, but swiftly making import decisions is a primary condition
    for a sustainable pace of the developement team

Orders the product backlog
    - understands that the product backlog should be orderred. Priority, risk, value, learning opportunities, and dependencies are all taking into accound and balanced with each otehr.

Prefers face to face communication
    - understand that the best way to convey information is face to face communication. user storiers are explained in a personal conversation. if a tool is used for backlog management, its
    function is to support the dialogue. in never replaces good old-fashioned conversation.

knows modelling techniques
    - has a backpack full of valuable modeling techniques.  then know when to appli a specifiy model. Examples are business model generation, lean startup, or impact mapping. 
    based on thiese modles they know how to drive product success.

shares experiences
    - a greate product ownwer shares experiences with peeros. this might be within  the organization, and outside it: seminars and conferences are great way to share experiences and gather knowledge
    in addition, wirting down lessons learned can be valuable for other product owners.

owns user story mapping
    - should master thje concept of user story mapping. its a techniquyes thats add a secound dimension to your backlog. this visualization shows the big picture of the product backlog.
    jeff patton has write some excellent material about the concept of story mapping.

has a focus on functionality
    - a great product owner has a focus on functionality and the non functional aspects of the product. hours or even story points are less important.
    the goal of the product owner is to maximize the value for the customer. It's the functonality that has value; therefore, this is the main focus for the product owner.

Is Knowledgable
    - has in-depth (non)-fucntional product knowledge and understands the technical composition. For large products, it might be difficult to uinderstand all the details, and scaling the product ownder
    role might be an option, However, the product owner should always know the larger pieces of the puzzle  and hereby make conscious, solid decisions.

Understand the business domain 
    - unstand the business domain and environment they are part of. A product should always be built with its context taken into account, This includes understanding the organization 
    paying for the development but also being aware of the latyest market conditions. Shipping an awesome product after the window of opportinity closes is quite useless.

acts on different levels
    - the most common way to define these levels is strategic, tactical, and operational. a product owner should know how to explain the product strategy at board level, create support at middleware,
    and motivate the development team with their daily challenges

knows the 5 levels of Agile Planning
    - within agile, planning is done continuously.
    - level 1 -> Vision - will provide input to the
    - level 2 -> Product Roadmap -> a long range strategic plan of how th ebusiness would like to see the product evolve.
    - level 3 -> Releases -The product owner can plan this based on the product roadmap, market conditions, and status of the product.
    - level 4 -> Sprint planning -> the team plan and agree on Product Backlog items the are confindent they can complete during the sprint and help the achive the sprint goal
    - level 5 -> Daily Scrum -> used to inspect and adapt team's progress towards realizing the sprint goal.

is available
    - available to the stakeholder, the customers, the development team, and the scrum master. important questions are answer quiuckly and valuable information is provided on time.
    the product owner ensures that their availability never blocks the progress of the development team.

is able to say 'No'
    - the most obvious, but most difficult characteristic to master. Saying yes to a new idea or feature is easy; However, good backlog management encompasses creating manageable product
     backlog with items that probably will get realized. Adding items to the backlog knowing nothing will happen with them only creates 'waste' and false expectations.

Acts as a "Mini-CEO"
    - they have a keen eye for opportunititesm focus on business value and the Return on Investment and acti proactively on possible risks and threats.
    Everything with the growth(Size, quality, and market share) of the produc taken into account

Knows the different types of valid Product Backlog items
    - can clarify the fact that the product backlog consists of more than only new features. For example:
        * technical innovation
        * bugs
        * defects
        * non-functional requirements and experiments
    should be also taken into account

Takes backlog refinement seriously
    - spends enough time refining the product backlog. Backlog Refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the product backlog. The outcome should
    be a Product Backlog that is granular enough and well understood by the whole team.
