Scrum

    - a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products
    - means that a team can use Scrum to create valuable products for their users, even when the environment or industry they're in is hard to predict and there are many risks

Iterative
     - repeating cycles of delivery

Incrementa
    - work is divided into smaller chunks that build on each other
    - The product is built over time through work done during each iteration

Empiricism
    - a scientific theory that depicts that the idea that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience.

3 foundational pillars of Empiricism (AKA the three pillars of Scrum)
    - transparency
    - inspection
    - adaptation

transparency
    - we make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome.
    - everyone must be transparent.
    - transparency inside the scrum team is critcal to the team's productivity and the project's completion
    - transparency means also building trust outside of the scrum team, like the stakeholders(customers, sponsors, and management )
    - encourages more collaboration and fewer mistakes

inspection
    - refers to conducting timely checks towards te outcome of a sprint goel to detect undesirable variances.
    - when teams work in an agile way, a stakeholder review of their work is a necessary opportunity for growth and progress.
    - the more inspection that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in their work.
    - There's real valuye to be gained from delibrerate inspection while you have a chance to change and improve.

Adaptation
    - Continuously searching for ways to adjust our project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.

In a nutshell
    Transparency and inspection gives Scrum teams the information and opportunity they need to identify improvements or changes. 
    althouogh adaptations include immediate fixes to problems, it may also be about implementing a change so future projects don't repeat past mistakes

Scrum master vs project manager

scrum master is responisble for helping the team understand scrum theory and practice. they ensure sucrm events take place and hel the team focus on delivering value
by removing impediments. but unlike a traditional project manager, they do not take on the management of changes in scope or priorities.
additionallym scrum master do not maintain tradional project artifacets like gantt charts.

==================================================================================
PRoduct owner vs project manager

In traditional project management, scope management is the primary responsibility of the project manager. But in Scrum, the definition and management of product scope falls to the
 Product Owner. Conversely, the Product Owner isn’t responsible for team performance—they aren’t considered to be a manager. The project manager leads the project team to meet the
  project’s objectives and oversees tasks and progress.

There are also similarities between the Product Owner and project manager roles. For instance, both roles are tasked with stakeholder management. This means they both must practice 
and facilitate effective communication among team members and stakeholders.

Additionally, in many companies—including Google—the definition of product or solution scope is the responsibility of a separate role called a product manager. So, it is 
important when joining any new company to discover how that company approaches the area of product definition, requirements development, and user research to understand what they 
consider to be the domain of the project manager.
