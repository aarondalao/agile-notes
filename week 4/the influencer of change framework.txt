The Influencer change framework - Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler

What does it mean to be an Influencer?

It is about someone's ability to lead and influence others to change their behaviors, hearts, and minds to produce
meaningful, sustainable results. As a project manager you will be asked to lead efforts that require this level
of change, and applying this model can lead to a big impact.

To influence is different that to persuade. Persuasiuon is short-term, while influence is lasting, In order to have 
real influence, you need others to trust you, consider you an authority, and have confidence in your decisions. As a 
Project Manager in Agile projects, You may use influence to facilitate organizational change or to get a team to try a
new tool, process or technology. When facilitating organizational change, influence is the diference between temporary
changes in behavior and deep change in culture and values.

Three keys to influence

* Clarify measurable results
    - You can't inflence others to chagne until you know what you want, why you want it, and when you want it.
    - remember that an effective results are S.M.A.R.T.
        - Specific
        - measurable
        - achievable
        - relevant 
        - time-bound
    - remember to ask yourself what are the "why" entails whenb setting goals for a project.
    - make sure the me3asures are visible and transparent to the entire team throughout change.

* Find vital behaviors
    - Vital Behavior
        - the action an individual taks a pivotal moment in the context of the change they are seeking
    - real change happens when you can change the behaviors of others. Whenever you are changing the minds of you team, 
    stakeholders, or customers, it is important to track their current behavior patterns and understand the behaviors
    you need them to adopt in order to make the change you are seeking.
    - to determine vital behaviors, you might consult experts, scan the best and most cited-articles and research, or
    perform a culture assessment by identifying norms and custom within the team.
    - When identifying the behaviours, evaluate which behaviours are constructive to the change ytou wish to promote 
    and notice examples of those who succeed where most others fail.

* Use the six sources of influence
    - The authors of INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change studied companies and individuals who were successful
    or unsuccessful with implementing change, and they identified six sources or factors that were correlated with 
    successful change.
    - consider using all of these sources to increase you chances of success. You may even consider prioritizing these
    based or your knowledge of your audience.

    1) Personal motivation
        are the individuals motivated internally to engage in the new behavior? Can you help them "love what they hate"?
    
    2) Personal ability
        Are the individuals capable of performing the behavior? do they have the ability, knowledge, and skills to "do 
        what they can't"?

    3) Social motivation    
        are there social contacts or networks encouraging or discouraging this new behavior?

    4) Social ability
        Does the team have resources within their social network to help them carry out the new behaviors?
    
    5) Structural motivation
        are there rewards or incentives that they will receive if they perform the new behaviours?\

    6) Structural ability
        are there environmental factors at play that either deter or support the new behavoir? can you make the 
        incorrect behavior harder to do than the correct behavior?
