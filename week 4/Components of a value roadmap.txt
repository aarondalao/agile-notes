Components of a Value Roadmap

value roadmap 
    * An Agile way of mapping out the productive development process
    * Can be used to all types of businesses
    * A guide that demonstrates
        - where to go
        - How to get there
        - What to accomplish along the way
    * Helps the team explain the vision of the product
    * Used to identify important milestones

A typical value roadmap has:
    * Product vision
        - Crutical step to starting any Scrum project. it is based on your user interviews and market analysis and becomes 
            the team's north star (it what guides the team). 
        - what the product is
        - How it supports the customers business Strategy
        - who will use it
    * Product Roadmap
        - The Product owner is responsible for creating and maintaining this.
        - provides a high-level view of the expected product, its requirements, and an estimated schedule for reaching milestones.
    * Release Plans
        - The Product owner and the project manager work together to develop these plans.
        - product releases occur when the team has developed a basic working version of a given feature or requirement.
        - A release plan includes the approximate date when the tema is expected to release and deliver certain features to the
        customer or user.
        - An Agile team meay have several releases over the course of a project untin their project is considered done. For this reason, 
        only the first release should be considered to be set in stone. the rest of the release plan is based on early estimates and is
        subject to change as the project proceeds.
        - a release plan has: 
            * release goal
                - overall business goal for the features that you plan to include in the release
            * list of the backlog items
                - epics
                - user stories
                - or features that you require for that release goal
            * an estimated release date
            * any other relevant dates that impact a release
                - like convention 
                - or major holiday
        - it is important to add all you release plans to your value roadmap to helpo you stay focused on the path to your overall Value
        goal

Product roadmaps: Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices

you may see different roadmaps as you continue your project management career. each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly
differently. Here are some various types: 
    * Project roadmap
    * Product roadmap
    * Value roadmap
    * Lean roadmap
    * Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are ofter represented visually and many try to find the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of 
the product timeline.

Benefits:
    * Clarifying the sequence of deliverables
    * shoing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. meaning their ultimate goal
    * showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one
    big delivery at the end)
    * Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

Pitfalls:
    * Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams' ability to adapt in 
    response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.
    * Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improvising specifically as the dates get closer
    * putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producting the deliverables.

Best practices:
    * Make it highly noticable to the team and refer to it frequently
    * Clearly indicate the highest priority items.
    * If Possible, clearly indicate the highes value items.
    * Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning.
    * Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the 
    blueprint for the project

Key takeaways:
Roadmaps are important for any well-managed project, but they are especially useful to Agile teams. Having a shared roadmap about what
the tam is deliverying over a longer period is an important way to connect the working that the team does on sprints with broader
vision for the project. This helps the team stay motivated through the rough patches and leads to a great sense of accomplishment
as roadmap deliverables are achieved.
