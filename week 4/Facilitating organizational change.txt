The role as a project manager in an organization that wants to implement Agile Practices.

When an organization shifts the way it conducts busimess, it ussually requires a shift in its 
culture as well. Understanding organizational culture and the change manageent process is crucial
when introducing new ways of working.

Organizational culture
    - based on shared workplace values and pops up in people's behaviors, activityes, and the way 
    they communicate, and how they work with each other.
    - a change that's our of sync with the existing culture is much more difficult to complete.
    - in fact, theres research proving that companies that dont consider the cultural aspects of
    Agile are more likely to fail.

Change management
    - the process of getting folks to adopt new product, processs, or in Agile's case, a new value
    system.
    - Unless the organization has many years of Agile Behaviors and experience, you may be facing 
    a change in organizational culture. These changes TAKES TIME. sometimes years to complete.
    - Youll still be adding value by demonstrating to your team or organization new and different
    ways of approaching their business.
    - "Change takes patient persistence." It may feel like things are taking too long, but in many cases, 
    small change add up to a big change in the long run.

Ways i can bring Agile or Scrum to a new taem:

1) Think of ways to create a sense of ownership and urgency
    - When people feel a sense of ownership and ugency around the project it increases interest, motivation, and 
    engagement with the project outcome. 

    One way to create sense of ownership:

        * find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change that you are creating. Whenever 
        possible, point out connections between changes you 're making and the company's stated mission or values. 
        Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chages of successfully driving any change in organizational
        culture. Ideally, your sponsor will reinforce the benefits of Agile to the organization and give you the support
        and resources you need.

    Create a sense of urgency:

        * Ask the team, the organization, and the stakeholders questions about what's working and what's not working 
        right now. Then I ensure the changes relate directly to those opportunities.

        Sample Questions:
            * What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers?
            * What is allowing our competitors to outperform use in this market? 
            * How can we help our teams becoue more productive and supportive in their work?

        This not only helps you prioritize your work, you get the team thinking about the possibilities they'll enjoy
        if the change is successful. You can use these questions going forward to collect feedback during the change.
        Coming back to these questions and demonstrationg the incremental improvements is the true spirit of Agile.
