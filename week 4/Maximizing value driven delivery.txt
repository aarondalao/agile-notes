all about value

Value 
    - can mean different things for each customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish.
    - The end product of a project is what provides value to the user. value could mean financial benefits, user growth and 
    engagement, or compliance adherance

VALUE DELIVERY
    - our highest priority is to satify the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    - deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the 
        shorter time scale
    - working software is the primary measure of progress
    - simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential
    - continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

the number one Agile Principle is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software/product\solution. Delivering value as quickly as possible
to users is the primary reason Agile came into existence.

Value-Driven delivery 
    - you and your team are focused on deliverying a product of high value

how to ensure the team is focused on a Value Driven delivery
    * Build the right thing
        -understand what the customer want

    * Build the thing right
        - Ensures that the team only builds the requested or approved features
        - Working on features that arent necessary can lead to complexities in the product that dont add any value to the users.
        - building more that you need delayes or reduces your value upon delivery, in addition, in also increases the risk of bugs or other issues down the road.

    * Run it right
        - your team has thought through how the use will interact with the product once it's been delivered
        - make sure your team thinks through some of the operational task that will need to be addressed after the product has left the door.
        - ask the following questions: 
            * How do users get support? 
            * how does the product add value to users long after they initially recieved it ?
            * How do you make sure that new features and capabilities reach existing users?

Building the right thing, building the thing right, and run it right all work together to ensure that the team creates a steady and continuous delivery of 
values to the users throughout the life of the product.
