What to expect
* Explore the result of the project
* Define "value" as it relates to project management
* Strategies and tactics to maximize the value of your end product

all about value

Value 
    - can mean different things for each customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish.
    - The end product of a project is what provides value to the user. value could mean financial benefits, user growth and 
    engagement, or compliance adherance

VALUE DELIVERY
    - our highest priority is to satify the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    - deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the 
        shorter time scale
    - working software is the primary measure of progress
    - simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential
    - continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

the number one Agile Principle is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software/product\solution. Delivering value as quickly as possible
to users is the primary reason Agile came into existence.

Value-Driven delivery 
    - you and your team are focused on deliverying a product of high value

how to ensure the team is focused on a Value Driven delivery
    * Build the right thing
        -understand what the customer want

    * Build the thing right
        - Ensures that the team only builds the requested or approved features
        - Working on features that arent necessary can lead to complexities in the product that dont add any value to the users.
        - building more that you need delayes or reduces your value upon delivery, in addition, in also increases the risk of bugs or other issues down the road.

    * Run it right
        - your team has thought through how the use will interact with the product once it's been delivered
        - make sure your team thinks through some of the operational task that will need to be addressed after the product has left the door.
        - ask the following questions: 
            * How do users get support? 
            * how does the product add value to users long after they initially recieved it ?
            * How do you make sure that new features and capabilities reach existing users?

Building the right thing, building the thing right, and run it right all work together to ensure that the team creates a steady and continuous delivery of 
values to the users throughout the life of the product.

insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors.

when reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the
solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

as you read, ask yourself: 
    * what is the issue?
    * What is the goal of the analysis?
    * What is the context of the problem?
    * What key facts should be considered?
    * What alternatives area  available to the decision-maker?

Value -driven delivery at Sephora : external reading


The case study linked below is about how the teams at Sephora, the multinational retailer of personal care and beauty products, 
created value-driven delivery by forming an Agile task force. 

As the case study details, Sephora’s goal was to develop an organized and efficient process for rolling out customer-centered i
nitiatives. The beauty retailer wanted to maximize their paid media and create custom messaging that was personalized to meet their 
customers’ needs.

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study. Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were 
essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate, test, and analyze. 

When you are finished, think about how Scrum benefitted Sephora and how it improved their overall business model.


At the heart of what we do at Sephora lives a desire to deliver best-in-class experiences for our client, be it shopping on our app,
 an enjoyable journey through one of our stores, or personalized recommendations based on products they love.


With so many initiatives in the queue to serve our clients, we need an organized, efficient process to turn these ideas into realities.
 That’s where our newest task force comes in: the Sephora Stat Sig team! This dedicated group of strategists, data scientists, analysts
 , information technologists, developers, creatives, marketers, and product managers come together to do what we do best — but faster.

“It’s a progressive way of working,” said Sabrina Keller, Senior Manager, Personalization & Optimization and activation lead. “Not 
many retailers are doing this.”

This agile process, Scrum, allows us to be nimbler and rapidly test and measure while maintaining accuracy and quality. It brings 
people from across the organization together to ideate, test, analyze, and relentlessly ask the “what-ifs?” to take personalization and
media to the next level.


Central to Scrum is a sprint, in which the Stat Sig team performs a “stand-up” where ideas are created, then tested, analyzed, and 
rolled out. All of this happens in the War Room, an area on the second floor of 425 Market Street that has been transformed into a 
workspace with charts, calendars, to-do lists, and a lot of post-its. It serves as the single point of coordination for all the Stat Sig team’s Scrum 
activities.

It wouldn’t be Sephora without a little flair, though — daily progress on CRM and media initiatives are tracked by a team of racing 
unicorns!

Multiple teams are represented in the War Room, which is extremely important to ensure a holistic view of each pilot the team works on 
across different channels. Emmanuelle Paput, Director, CRM Strategy, serves as the Agile lead and oversees all the agile processes 
across the different teams. She bridges the communication between the activation leads, who each are responsible for initiating a pilot within their 
own respective channels.

“It’s a really magical way of working because it’s helped us to pass barriers and move faster in a friendly environment,” Emmanuelle s
aid. “We all talk different languages, but Scrum allows us to work in the same process, which provides a real synergy across all 
different people and skill sets.”

Some goals the team has been working on in 2018 is accelerating the way we deliver messaging and experiences that are responsive to 
client needs and behaviors, and maximizing our paid media by finding efficiencies that can be redirected to the most impactful 
opportunities.

Above all, Scrum is showing how our teams live our values every day: initiative is key because they are ideating and working on 
something that has never been done before; expertise is called upon because multiple teams are contributing something that falls in 
their specific realm of functional expertise; and of course, teamwork.

“Previous to Scrum, each of the cha nnels within paid media were living in silos,” said Jennifer Nguyen, Paid Media Manager and 
activation lead. “One of the great things coming out of this is the insight and teamwork among non-paid media channels.”

“We work as #oneteam,” said Andrea Zaretsky, SVP, Loyalty, CRM, and Analytics. “We celebrate each other’s functional expertise and 
contributions to the mission, and above all, we strive to innovate every day to delight our clients by serving up personalized and 
relevant value.”

if I were to create a new product, I would make a modular smartwatch that would cater for a lot of people, from fashion to adventurers, fitness jockeys, and first-time buyers who only want a wearable companion. The main feature would be a modular watch frame, where a user can install a module to customize their wearable smartwatch based on the functions they want to do. whether they want their smartwatch to be touchscreen, or a solar-powered one, with a smaller or bigger battery, with a different Global navigational satellite system, or just wanted to change the straps.
