        and Design Thinking methodologies. 
    - puts the goal of deliverying value above all else
        - first principle of SAFe is "take an economic view"
    - organizes all work and teams into "Agile Relase Trains" based of value streams
    - it is mature and provides detailed guidance on all elements of using SAFe, but some elements are more critical than
        others. Be sure to check back to the Agile Principles and values in the manifesto to be sure you are preserving 
        agility.

Scrum of Scrums
    - is a technique for integrating the work of multiple, smaller Scrum teams working on the same project or solution.
    - Coordination among teams is critical to ensuring the deliverables from each team can be integrated into one larger,
        cohesive deliverable.
    
    Elements of Scrum of Scrums:
    * A group of at least 12 or more people divided into Scrum Teams of 5 to ten people each.
    * Scrum of Scrum meetings, which are held once a week, twice a week, or daily. These meetings follow the same format
        as a Daily Scrum meetings buyt focus on the scrum team. In these meetings, you'll discuss the questions like:
        "What did the team do yesterday? What problems occurned,if any, that are negatively affecting your team? What 
        does your team want to accomplish before we meet again? Is your team blocked from moving forward on any tasks?"
    * A Scrum master or designated "ambassador" for each team that participates in the Scrum of Scrums meetings and a 
        Scrum or Scrums Master who focuses on the overall Scrum process accross multiple teams.
    * Sprint planning, Sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings.

    Beyond these basic guidelines, there is no official framework or methodology to implement Scrum of Scrums. Scrum of 
    Scrums assumes that teams have good working background and understanding of Scrum and are able to apply the scaling 
    principles to how they work. Building on these knowledge, they design and iterate their own approach to coordinate
    multiple teams working on the same product.

Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)
    - a framework that aims to maximize the Scrum team's ability to deliver and reduce waste in large organizations.
