Scaling Agile

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
    - is a Lean-Agile scaling framework that draws heavily on concepts from Kanban, Scrum, Extreme programming(XP), DevOps
        and Design Thinking methodologies. 
    - puts the goal of deliverying value above all else
        - first principle of SAFe is "take an economic view"
    - organizes all work and teams into "Agile Relase Trains" based of value streams
    - it is mature and provides detailed guidance on all elements of using SAFe, but some elements are more critical than
        others. Be sure to check back to the Agile Principles and values in the manifesto to be sure you are preserving 
        agility.
    
    Core set values of SAFe
    * Alignment
        - Synchronize the planning and execution of SAFe activities at all levels of the organization.
    * Built-in Quality
        - Build quality into all stages of solution development
    * Transparency
        - Make execution activities visible at all levels to build trust among teams and accorss the organization.
    * Program Execution 
        - Focus on working systems and business outcomes
    * Leadership
        - Model the values and principles of SAFe

Scrum of Scrums
    - is a technique for integrating the work of multiple, smaller Scrum teams working on the same project or solution.
    - Coordination among teams is critical to ensuring the deliverables from each team can be integrated into one larger,
        cohesive deliverable.
    
    Elements of Scrum of Scrums:
    * A group of at least 12 or more people divided into Scrum Teams of 5 to ten people each.
    * Scrum of Scrum meetings, which are held once a week, twice a week, or daily. These meetings follow the same format
        as a Daily Scrum meetings buyt focus on the scrum team. In these meetings, you'll discuss the questions like:
        "What did the team do yesterday? What problems occurned,if any, that are negatively affecting your team? What 
        does your team want to accomplish before we meet again? Is your team blocked from moving forward on any tasks?"
    * A Scrum master or designated "ambassador" for each team that participates in the Scrum of Scrums meetings and a 
        Scrum or Scrums Master who focuses on the overall Scrum process accross multiple teams.
    * Sprint planning, Sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings.

    Beyond these basic guidelines, there is no official framework or methodology to implement Scrum of Scrums. Scrum of 
    Scrums assumes that teams have good working background and understanding of Scrum and are able to apply the scaling 
    principles to how they work. Building on these knowledge, they design and iterate their own approach to coordinate
    multiple teams working on the same product.

Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)
    - a framework that aims to maximize the Scrum team's ability to deliver and reduce waste in large organizations. 
    - LeSS grew out of more than 600 experinements that expanded the practice of scrum to a larger groups.

    10 Principles for applying the value, elements, and overall purpose of Scrum accros an organization. These principles
    were designed to create more customer-focused and more collaboration focused teams. LeSS teams prioritize learning,
    transparency, and customer needs. The principles are:

        1) Large-scale Scrum is Scrum
            - Apply the values and principles of Scrum to a larger team.
        2) Empirical process control
            - Inspect, adapt, and learn from experience to improve processes
        3) Transparency 
            - Ensure clarity and accessibility accross a project
        4) more with less 
            - Create only necessary processes, roles, artifacts, and waste when scalling.
        5) Whole-product focus 
            - think holistically about the product, making sure that all the parts serve the whole.
        6) Customer-centric
            - keep the customers needs and values at the heart of your process.
        7) Continuous improvement towards perfection
            - improve the product - and your process - during every single sprint
        8) Systems Thinking
            - Think about the system as a whole; dont get lost in the details
        9) Lean Thinking
            - Seek continuous improvement; aim for perfection, and respect people
        10) Queuing theory
            - embrace the lean principle of "flow, manage queue size" and "minimize multitasking" to keep delivering value.
    
    The LeSS toolkit provides two frameworks - one for up to 50 people (called Basic LeSS) and one for 50-6000+ people (called
    LeSS Huge)

Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)
    - hybrid approach that combines the strategies from various agile frameworks, including kanban., LeSS, Lean Development,
        Extreme Programming, Agile Modelling, and more. 
    - DAD guides people through the process related decisions that frameworks like SAFe and Scrum of Scrums leave open.
    - helps you devellp a scaled Agile strategy based on context and desired outcomes.

    4 layers of DAD
