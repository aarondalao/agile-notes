Common coaching challenges

* Managing a Stable product roadmap

    Agile projects almost always experience changes in the product roadmap. Being able to respond quickly and productively to these changes is
    a core Agile Value. But it is possible to have too much change impacting the project, which can lead to an unstable product roadmap.

    Two main causes of an unstable product roadmap:
    * Product Ambition

        Product ambition poses a challenge when a product leadership is overly ambitious about what the team can realistically deliver. The
    Product owner is responsible for representing the project to customers and executives. Because the product owner wants to make the 
    stakeholders happy, it can be easy for them to over-promise what the project can deliver. 

    Product Ambition Solutions
    There are three ideas to to maintain a healthy roadmap management plan between you and the product owner:

        1) Agreed upfront how to handle new opportunities
            Define when they are reviewed and estimated, andhow custome or management commitments are made.
        
        2) Setup regular roadmap reviews with the entire team
            - at least, quarterly so that everyone knows what to expect.
        
        3) Promote sharing knowledge between the product owner and the development team so that the product owner knows how much effort the
        product takes to build and the team is aware of changes as early as possible.

    * Product Assumption

        THe second thing that can cause an unstable product roadmap is making too many product assumptions. When there is uncertainty in a 
    project, you may be required to make some assumptions to move things forward but making too m any assumptions can jeopardize the team's
    success.

    Product assumptions Solutions

        1) document the assumptions and make them transparent. 
            - This allows you to discuss the assumptions as a team and either agree that they're safe assumptions to make or decide to question
        and double check them.

        2) if you decide to double check them, you can use unbiased user research.

            Unbiased research
                - gathers information about what users really want. It allows you to confirm or reject assumptions and helps you move forward with 
            confidence. User research could involve conducting surveys, running focus groups, or using orther methods to collect objective data 
            about your users.

* Incomplete implementation of Scrum

* Experiencing a lack of stability within the team
