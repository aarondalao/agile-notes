Creating an effective valuye Roadmap

Value Roadmap

* helps you determine specific routes for your team deliver the most value
* uses the basic events of scrum to define product goals and requirements so the team can deliver successfull final product.

tips on creating an effective product roadmap

* The product roadmap provides a high level view of the expected product, its requirements and an estimated timeline for reaching
milestones.

    Many of these milestones will be product release dates. Youll need to ensure that product release dates are only rough estimates.
    this is because as an Agile team, things can change and do change. this is especially true since thses dates could be anywhere 
    from several months to several years down the road. if the roadmap is too specificm it might set the team up for failure because
    the dates can't ge guaranteed.

tips on creating a release plan

* Product Owner and Project Manager or Scrum Manager must work together
* release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team's capacity and velocity
    - Capacity and Velocity
        * The measure of the team's ability to complete work at a certain pace
    - a release plan that isnt connected to the teams ability to complete work could be unrealistin and lead to an unsustailable pace
    for the team. This would violate one of our Agile Principles, which states that Agile Processes, promote sustainable development.
    the sponsors, developeres, and suers sould be able to maintain constant pace indefinitely.
* Factor in any "hard" dates and deadlines 


        Since Agile is all about embracing and anticipating change, it might seem like having a release plan goes against the actual 
    value of responding to change over following a plan. But having a release plan does not mean you are resistant to change. 
    And Agile team treats a release plan as a living artifact. So the plan can change based on the environment and new information 
    that's received. 
    
    Some common factors that may result in a change to the release plan could include:
        * a change in team velocity
            - how much work the team can do in a given iteration or Sprint. This could be from adding or losing team members or even 
            just efficiency gains from how they work. 
        * A second factor is a change to the product scope. 
            - If the Product Owner approves the change to the product.
        * improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features. 
            - The team may discover that a user story or epic is more or less difficult than they originally thought, after doing some 
            research or simply from better understanding the product space. 
            
My last tip for creating an effective value roadmap is that the Scrum Master or Project Manager should always review the release plan 
before starting a Sprint planning session. They review the release plan to check whether the team is on track. If the team is off track, 
the Scrum Master needs to have an open conversation with the Product Owner and business people to figure out what they can adjust 
to get back on track.This is where the Scrum Value of transparency is key. An effective value roadmap is a powerful tool for building 
and delivering successful products. The plans you create will help you stay focused on delivering maximum value and the ability to 
remain flexible and stay Agile.
