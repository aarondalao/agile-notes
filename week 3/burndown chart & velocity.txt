Burndown Charts
    - measures time against the amount of work done and the amount of work 
    remaining.
    - the goal of the burndown chart is to keep the team aware of who they'recognize
    doing against the overall goals.
    - in a scrum team, burndown charts reflect how to team is doing with completing
    user stories during the sprint.
    - the scrum master will review the burndown chart, sometimes daily, to examine 
    if the team will hit their goals or not.
    -In Scrum, a burndown chart reflects the team's progress completing user stories
    and the amount of work completed in the sprint.
    - if your team is using t shirt sizes instead of story points, simply map the sizes 
    to a numver adn use that number for the burndown and velocity calculations. for example,
    an extra small is 1 point, small = 2 pnt, medium = 5 pts, and so on.

velocity
    - points a team burns down in a sprint on average.
    - measure of how many poihnts a team burns down during a single sprint on average.
    - when a team is conducting Sprint Planning, Theyre using average velocity over at 
    least three sprints to determine how many items they can safely add to their sprint
    backlog.
    - few notes on velocity calculations:
        - there is no such thing as good or bad velocity.
            - it is simply what the team has historically been able to achieve in a
            predetermined timebox.
        - each team  will have different velocity, especially since each team decides 
        on their own point system callibration. 
    - once you have a stable velocity and a refined backlog with prioritization and estimates,
    this undlocks an incredibly valuable superpower. You can now tell you stakeholders and 
    sponsors two important things. You can tell tehm approximately how long it will take to
    complete the entire product backlog and how much of your backlog will be completed by 
    a particular time. This ability to confidently predict when things can get down 
    is ne of the most powerful tools in Agile and Scrum.
