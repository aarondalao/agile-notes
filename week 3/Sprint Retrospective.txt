Sprint Retrospective
    - An essential meeting of up to 3 hours for the Scrum team to take a step back
    , reflect, and identify improvements about how to work together as a team.

Reflections to do for the Scrum Team in Sprint Retrospective:
*   what's working or not working for the team regarding the people, the process,
and the tools.
*   What improveents are workth exploring in the next sprint?
*   What improvements were put in place for the last Sprint? Were they helpful or not? why?

Some Key measures to take to ensure Sprint Retrospective are a success:
* blamelessness 
    - its important to demonstrate the Scrum Value of respect and always allow the team
    to remain blameless.
    - if any team member is worried there may be negative consequences for providing
    feedback, your outcome wont be as a beneficial.
    - need to create a safe space for candor by acknowledging potential awkwardness, and
    if needed, create a space for anonymous or private feedback.
* Participation
    - is key because retrospective only works if participants feel like their input matters
    - if you notice folks arent volunterring their perspectives, search for ways
    to generate new ideas, such as asking them: What is one thing we could try 
    in the next sprint? What slowed us down? What happened that we didnt expect? 
    The answer to these questions can help you understand how to improve.
* balance the negatives with the positives
    - dont just ask where you can improve, but also ask things like, where did we
    notice success? You want your team to feel like they were successful, and you also
    want to recreate these successful outcomes.
* make sure to act on it
    - team can get discouraged from participating in future retrospectives if it feels 
    like their feedback wont inspire change. Search for improvements, or simply convert 
    the things that worked the best into your team's habits and norms.

    and a project manager.
