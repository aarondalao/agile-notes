        we want to discuss, use images with variation and colors and sizes as we check in on work items, and we can notice 
        where the challenges are in our team. 

    * work-in-progress limits (WIP limits) 
        - are contstraints on how many work items the team actively works on at any given time.
        - these provices focus for the team, which is one of our scrum team values.
        - each team may set a WIP limit based on their configuration and context. this way, its really obvious to noticewhen the
        team is going beyond the wip limit.
        
    * flow of work
        - kanban board can give you a better sense of flow of work through the teams execution process. 
        - Physical Post-it notes or even virtual versions of Kanban or Scrum boards allows the team to experience the movement of 
        work from one phase to another.
        - Using a Kanban or Scrum board, the team will move the items through the following stages: todo, doing, and done. This action
        often takes place during the daily scrum, but the team can move items at any time.
