Notes:
    - the most efficient and effective menthod of conveying informatiopn to and within
    a Dev Team is face to face conversation.

two kinds of face to face events:
    - Daily Scrum 
    - Sprint Review

Daily Scrum
    - also refered as Stand up
    - synchronizes and prioritize activies for the day.
    - 15 mins, same time and place everyday, each team members answers the following questions:
        - What did i to yesterday that helped the dev team, meet the Sprint goal?
        - What will i do today to help the Dev team meet the Sprint Goal?
        - Do i notice any impediment that prevents me or the team from meeting our goals?
    - should provide the scrum master with the opportunity to quickly unblock the team with little delay
    - Daily stand ups are an opportunity to reinforce focus on the Sprint Backlog and Goal.
    - must happen everyday, as per the Official Scrum Guide.
    - can be less frequent and still be as effective as the suggested time block period set by the
        Official Scrum Guide.
    
Sprint Review
    - crucial to the Scrum Pillars of inspection and adaptation, and demonstrate the values of 
    openness, courage, and respect.
    - a meeting with the entire scrum team where the product is demonstrated in order to determine
    which aspects are finished and which aren't.
    - key members of this event: 
        - Dev team
        - Product Owner
    - will cover an exploration of which items shoudbe considered done in the Product Backlog
    - should be really fun and uplifting, this is the time when teams gets to impress each other
    with the cool things theyve accomplished over the last 1 to 4 weeks.
    - time boxed meetings should not be exceed 4 hours and theyre a good opportunity for the team
    to practice the Scrum Values of openness and respect, and they give feedback about the completed
    work. 
    - is a time for the team to demonstrate what they've accomplished and unveils what is called
    the product increment
    - at the end of each sprint, only items that have met the definition of done are considered 
    part of the Product Increment.
    - Anything that is not done goes back to the Product Backlog.

benefits of group inspection of work product
    - it makes the feedback as immediate as possible. no need to wait for people to review on
     their own and senting their feedback later on.
    - everyone has a voice, leeding to a shared sense of ownershopoof every aspect of their
    product launch.
    - the team learn smore about how theire marketing teammates does their job, leading to 
    greater trust and understanding between team members.

Product Increment
    - what's produced after a given sprint and considered releasable.
    - a product is releaseable when the team has developed a Minimun Viable Product

Minimum Viable Product 
    - is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers.


===================================================================================================================================

Releasable Increment versus Minimum Viable Product

Scrum Gude states that "An Increment is a concrete stepping stone towards the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior
increments  and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be
usable."

Potentially releaseble product increment

Potentially releasable (or shippable) Product increment is a handy way for teams to think about the desired result of a Sprint. 
The goal for every Sprint is to result in a completed, tested, ready-to-ship addtion to the product or solution. This doesn't mean
the product will actually ship to customers - that is why they use the word "potentially". Consider, for example, building an application
for finding and adopting pets. Three features on the product backlog could be:

    * Presenting information about available pets
    * Rating potential matches base on adopters
    * Alloing user to contact the adoption center

It doesnt make any sense to ship one of those features in isolation, but finishing a potentially releasable product increment is helpful
because it enables the team to see one feature in its entirity rather that to work on bits and pieces of all three features with none
of them actually completed. With a potentially releaseable Product increment, you will create a complete, working, tested implementation
of one feature in a single sprint.

having a potentially releaseable increament also allows the team to get ealry feedback on the porduc, ensure that the work is high quality,
and have the opportunity to respond to change. You should always focuys on a potentially releasable product increment as your sprint goal.


Definition of Done
    - is a formal description of the state of the potentially releasable product increment and what it means when it meets the 
    quality measures required for the product. It is the team's agreed-upon requirements for any backlog item that is considered "done".
    - the important part of figuring out your team's definition of done is to have an explicit, shared understanding of what being "done"
    entails.
    - In a Scrum Team, it is ultimately the decision of the product owner to ensure there is value before releasing an item. to determine
    this, they may consider a few things:
        - Is the increment complete?
        - Will it bring value and does it meet quality measures? Has it been well-tested?
        - is it usable by the end user? Can we use their direct or indirect feedback to improve future versions of the product? 

Comparing Releaseable product Increment to Minimum Viable Product

Mininum Viable Product (MVP) 
    - is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers.
    - Coined by Eric Ries, "that version of a new product wich allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about
    customers with the least effort."
    - gathering insights from an MVP enables quicker feedback from users that developing a full featured product that may not be 100%
    tested or secure.
    - Some examples:
        - a landing page for your website
        - a "buy now" button that doesnt do anything other than register that someone has clicked it.

A minimum viable product is a package of features that may take seveal sprints to develop, but every sprint's goal is to produce a 
product increment. 

Key Takeaways

so can a releasable incremnet be an MVP? yes. Does it always have to be an MVP? not necessarily. A Scrum Master or product owner is always 
making sure that the team is build potentially releasable increments of the solution or product. then, the product owner uses those product
increments and business insights to determine what will make up a valuable and viable relase of the product to their customers. This is
based on both user value deliverent and the ability to gather feedback that will continuously improve the product.
